        <h2>A Journey Through Time: The History of Neural Networks</h2>
        <p>Let's embark on a journey through time to explore the key milestones in the history of neural networks. Our story starts way back in 1943, when the first artificial neuron, called the "Threshold Logic Unit (TLU)," was proposed. This was a very basic mathematical model, but it laid the foundation for everything that followed.</p>

        <p>Andrew Ng, a leading figure in AI, once said, "The analogy to deep learning is that the rocket engine is the deep learning models and the fuel is the huge amounts of data we can feed to these algorithms."
