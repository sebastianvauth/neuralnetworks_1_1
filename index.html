Each layer can learn increasingly abstract features, enabling the network to capture complex patterns and relationships. For example, in image recognition, early layers might detect edges, while deeper layers could recognize more complex shapes or objects. This hierarchical learning allows multilayer networks to solve non-linearly separable problems, which single-layer networks cannot handle, such as the XOR problem or complex image classification tasks.</p>

Without backpropagation, networks were limited in depth and complexity, restricting their ability to learn intricate patterns.

            <h3>Why It Matters</h3>
            <p>The development of CNNs and RNNs showed that neural networks could be <strong>specialized</strong> for different types of data. This specialization is a key principle in designing effective AI systems for various tasks. It's not just about 'one-size-fits-all' networks; it's about tailoring the architecture to the problem.</p>

            <p>LSTMs significantly improved the ability of RNNs to process sequential data.

            <p id="stop-and-think-6" style="display: none;">Memory is crucial for processing sequential data like language because context from earlier parts often determines the meaning of later parts. For example, in the sentence "The man who wore a red hat left," understanding who left requires remembering the subject from the beginning of the sentence. In stories, character motivations, plot points, and themes often rely on information presented much earlier. LSTMs allow neural networks to maintain this kind of long-term context, enabling more human-like understanding and generation of language.</p>
