        <h2>A Journey Through Time: The History of Neural Networks</h2>
        <p>Hello and welcome! Before we get our hands dirty building neural networks, let's take a fascinating trip back in time. Like any great invention, neural networks didn't just appear overnight. They have a rich and intriguing history, filled with brilliant minds, unexpected turns, and moments of both excitement and disappointment. Understanding this journey will not only give you context but also a deeper appreciation for the powerful technology we're about to explore.</p>

        <h2>The Spark of an Idea (1943)</h2>
        <p>Our story begins in <strong>1943</strong>, a time when computers were giant, room-filling machines, not the sleek devices in our pockets today. Imagine the world then...</p>

        </div>
        <p>In this era, Warren McCulloch, a neurophysiologist, and Walter Pitts, a logician, teamed up to propose a groundbreaking idea: <strong>the first mathematical model of an artificial neuron!</strong> They called it the <strong>"Threshold Logic Unit (TLU)"</strong>.</p>
        <p>Think of the TLU as the very first spark â€“ the initial conceptualization of how we might mimic the brain's fundamental building block, the neuron, in machines. It was a rudimentary model, yes, but absolutely revolutionary for its time.</p>

        <h2>The Perceptron Takes Center Stage (1957)</h2>
        <p>Fast forward to <strong>1957</strong>. Rock and roll is taking over the radio, and in the world of computing, a significant step forward is made by <strong>Frank Rosenblatt</strong>.</p>

        <p>Rosenblatt developed the <strong>Perceptron</strong>, the first practical and trainable artificial neuron! He envisioned it as the simplest, yet fundamental, building block for neural networks. Imagine it as a single, trainable unit capable of learning to classify patterns.</p>

        <p>See how it takes inputs, processes them with weights and an activation function to produce an output? That's the magic of the Perceptron in a nutshell!</p>

        <h2>Multilayer Networks Emerge (1965)</h2>
        <p>The <strong>1960s</strong> were a time of exploration and expansion in many fields, and neural networks were no exception. By <strong>1965</strong>, researchers achieved another milestone: <strong>the first working feedforward multilayer network!</strong></p>

        <h2>Backpropagation: The Training Revolution (1970)</h2>
        <p>The <strong>1970s</strong> brought another pivotal development: <strong>the backpropagation algorithm was developed around 1970!</strong> While the exact history is a bit complex with multiple researchers contributing, the algorithm's impact is undeniable.</p>

        <p>Backpropagation was a game-changer. It provided an efficient way to train multilayer neural networks. Before backpropagation, training deep networks was incredibly difficult and computationally expensive.</p>

        </div>
        <p>See the dramatic difference in training efficiency? Backpropagation made deep networks truly trainable!</p>
        <p>This algorithm allowed networks to learn from their mistakes in a much more sophisticated way. It essentially calculates how much each weight in the network contributed to the error and then adjusts those weights to reduce the error. Think of it as a highly efficient feedback mechanism for learning.</p>

        <h2>Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) RNNs (1997)</h2>
        <p>Despite some challenges, research continued, and in <strong>1997</strong>, a significant improvement to Recurrent Neural Networks emerged: <strong>Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks were developed!</strong></p>

        </div>
        <p>LSTMs were designed to address a key limitation of standard RNNs: the vanishing gradient problem, especially when dealing with long sequences. LSTMs have a more complex internal structure that allows them to effectively learn long-range dependencies in sequential data.</p>

        </div>
        <p>LSTMs provided RNNs with 'long-term memory', making them much more powerful for tasks like language processing!</p>
        <p>This breakthrough made RNNs much more practical for applications like natural language processing, speech recognition, and time series analysis, where long-term dependencies are crucial.</p>
